Looks like a great idea for a drop box replacement. Found a small issue.  Your
setup script asks for a port number for us nonstandard guys, yet doesn't use
it for the setup. Here is the corrected setup that works for me.  Also I had
to go in manually and change permissions on the client since the id_dsa* had
all been created with root ownership (chown -R sync:sync /home/sync/.ssh/)
Might want to add that to your script as well.
