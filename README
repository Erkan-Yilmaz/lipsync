lipsync
An open source, BSD licensed Linux application that provides a command-line, 
Dropbox - like service, using OpenSSH, rsync and lsyncd.


==============
REQUIREMENTS
==============
Software requirements:

	* Linux 2.6.xx (client/server)
	* rsync (client/server)
	* OpenSSH-server (server)
	* OpenSSH-client (client)
	* lsyncd (client)

To run a base lipsync setup you need a client and a server. See the document 
doc/INSTALL-01-base.txt for details. For some this is all they'll need for a 
live backup system, however, once this is working you can build multiple clients
that sync to the same server, which fuctions more like a standard Dropbox. See 
the document doc/INSTALL-02-multiple-clients.txt for details.

Thanks to everyone that read, thought, commented and encourged the further 
development of this idea!
