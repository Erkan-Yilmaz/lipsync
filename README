lipsync
An open source, BSD licensed Linux application that provides a command-line, 
Dropbox - like service, using OpenSSH, rsync and lsyncd.


==============
REQUIREMENTS
==============
Software requirements:

	* Linux 2.6.xx (client/server)
	* rsync (client/server)
	* OpenSSH-server (server)
	* OpenSSH-client (client)
	* lsyncd (client)

To run a base lipsync setup you need a client and a server. See the document 
doc/INSTALL-01-base.txt for details. For some this is all they'll need for a 
live backup system, however, once this is working you can build multiple clients
that sync to the same server, which fuctions more like a standard Dropbox. See 
the document doc/INSTALL-02-multiple-clients.txt for details.

INSTALL
==============

see the doc/ directory

SERVER INSTALL
--------------
Debian (squeeze) / Ubuntu (karmic)
	apt-get install openssh-server rsync
Create a user to sync with, should be the same name as the one on the client 
	useradd -U -m -d /home/USER -p PASSWORD -s /bin/bash USER
Verfiy the account was created, and setup a sync directory
	su - USER
	mkdir sync


CLIENT INSTALL
--------------
Debian (squeeze)
	apt-get install openssh-client lsycnd rsync

Ubuntu (karmic)
	apt-get install openssh-client lsycnd rsync

	NOTE: lsyncd isn't in Ubuntu's repo, to build it install the build tools
		apt-get install libxml2-dev build-essential
	Get the lsyncd code (get the latest at http://lsyncd.googlecode.com)
		wget http://lsyncd.googlecode.com/files/lsyncd-1.39.tar.gz
		tar -zxf lsyncd-1.39.tar.gz
		cd lsyncd-1.39
	NOTE: modify the bindir to match how Debian does it
		./configure --bindir=/usr/bin
		make
	As root, install it
		make install
	Create a user to sync with, should be the same as the one on the server
	        useradd -U -m -d /home/USER -p PASSWORD -s /bin/bash USER


Now install lipsync (if installing from git, first apt-get git-core)
	cd lipsync
	chmod +x setup
	./setup.sh
Answer the questions, watch for errors.

On the client, test it
	su - USER
	touch sync/testfile
Check the logs 
	tail -f /var/log/lipsync.log
Check that the file was copied to the server

BACKSTORY
==============
lipsync is a the realization of a popular blog post I made last year:

Thanks to everyone that read, commented and encourged the further development of this idea!
