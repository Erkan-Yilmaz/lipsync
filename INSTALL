=========================

To get started with lipsync you need at least a client and a server.

SERVER INSTALL
----------------------------
Debian (squeeze) / Ubuntu (karmic)
	apt-get install openssh-server rsync

Create a user to sync with, should be the same name as the one on the client 
	useradd -U -m -d /home/USER -p PASSWORD -s /bin/bash USER

Verfiy the account was created, and setup a sync directory to sync with
	su - USER
	mkdir ~/sync


CLIENT INSTALL
----------------------------
Debian (squeeze)
Install required software
	apt-get install openssh-client lsycnd rsync

Debian users can skip down to 'Create a user to sync with...'

Ubuntu (karmic)
Install required software
	apt-get install openssh-client rsync

--------------
NOTE: lsyncd isn't in Ubuntu's repo, so if you're in Ubuntu have to build it
Install lsyncd (Ubuntu)
Install build tools
	apt-get install libxml2-dev build-essential

Get the lsyncd code (get the latest from http://lsyncd.googlecode.com)
wget http://lsyncd.googlecode.com/files/lsyncd-1.39.tar.gz
	tar -zxf lsyncd-1.39.tar.gz
	cd lsyncd-1.39

NOTE: during configure, modify the bindir to match how Debian does it
	./configure --bindir=/usr/bin
	make

Become root, if you're not already, and install it
	make install
--------------

Create a user to sync with, should be the same as the one on the server
        useradd -U -m -d /home/USER -p PASSWORD -s /bin/bash USER

Verfiy the account was created, and setup a sync directory to sync with
	su - USER
	mkdir ~/sync

Install lipsync (if installing from git, first apt-get git-core)
	cd lipsync
	chmod +x setup

Run setup
NOTE: during setup, define server IP, SSH port, paths, username and password
	./setup.sh

After you've answered the questions, watch for errors.




=========================
|	  TEST		|	
=========================

Open 3 terminals

Terminal 1 - on the client, become root and watch the logfile
	su - root
	tail -f /var/log/lipsyncd.log

Terminal 2 - on the client, become your normal user
	su - USER

Terminal 3 -  on the server, run a watch on the sync directory
	watch ls -l /home/USER/sync
NOTE: this terminal will refresh every 2s by default

Terminal 2 - on the client, create a new file in the sync directory
	touch sync/testfile

At this point you should see action on the logfile (Terminal 1), and after a 
few seconds delay, the file should appear in the server's sync directory 
(Terminal 2). If this worked, then delete the file on the client (Terminal 2)
and see if that change propogates to the server (Terminal 3). 

Now try more complex situations by using directories that are full of other 
files, then file or directory names with spaces in them, then ones with special 
characters (!@#$%^&*_-) in them. These should all work the same as the initial 
examples, always propogating to the server after a slight delay (the delay 
occurs so lsyncd can prevent spinning up for every little change - if there are
other changes after the first one they will be chained to the one sync, making
things more efficient)
